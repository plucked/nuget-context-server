Technical Blueprint: Building a C# Model Context Protocol Server for NuGet Context1. Introduction1.1. PurposeThis report provides a detailed technical guide for constructing a server application using C#. The primary function of this server is to analyze.NET project dependencies, specifically focusing on NuGet packages, and to interact programmatically with NuGet package sources. Critically, it will expose these capabilities as tools consumable by Large Language Models (LLMs) through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It serves as a blueprint for developers and architects tasked with building an MCP-compliant system that can provide context about library usage within software projects to AI models.1.2. Core Functionalities OverviewThe server application described herein will possess several key capabilities:
Project File Parsing: Analyzing Visual Studio solution (.sln) files and C# project (.csproj) files to accurately extract the list of referenced NuGet packages and their specified versions.
Programmatic NuGet Interaction: Utilizing the official NuGet Client SDK libraries in C# to communicate with NuGet package sources (such as the public nuget.org repository or private feeds). This includes retrieving comprehensive package metadata, listing all available versions for a package, checking for the latest available versions, and performing searches based on keywords or other criteria.
Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Implementation: Implementing an MCP server using the official ModelContextProtocol C# SDK to expose project parsing and NuGet interaction functionalities as tools callable by MCP clients (typically driven by LLMs). The server will primarily communicate via stdio transport.
Feed Handling: Supporting interactions with various types of NuGet feeds, including public repositories and private, potentially authenticated feeds, addressing the associated security considerations for credential management.
Operational Robustness: Incorporating mechanisms for effective error handling and logging to manage potential issues during file parsing, network communication, or MCP interactions.
Testing: Employing a robust testing strategy using NUnit for unit tests and potentially integration tests to ensure the reliability of parsing logic, NuGet interactions, and MCP tool implementations.
1.3. Target Audience and ScopeThe intended audience for this report consists of Software Developers and Architects proficient in C# and familiar with the.NET development ecosystem. The scope is focused on the C# implementation details, leveraging the NuGet V3 API protocol via the Client SDK, implementing a mandatory MCP server using the ModelContextProtocol C# SDK, and utilizing the.NET Generic Host for the server infrastructure. It provides guidance on library selection, API usage patterns, architectural structuring, testing strategies, and key operational considerations necessary for building the specified server application.2. Interacting with NuGet Programmatically via the Client SDK(This section remains unchanged as requested)2.1. Overview of the NuGet Client SDKThe official mechanism for programmatically interacting with NuGet functionalities in C# is the NuGet Client SDK. This SDK comprises a collection of.NET libraries that underpin the standard NuGet tooling, such as the Visual Studio integration, the dotnet command-line interface (CLI), and nuget.exe.It is crucial to understand the primary design philosophy behind the SDK. NuGet is fundamentally a tooling ecosystem, and the SDK libraries are developed primarily to support these tools. Consequently, the development team prioritizes the needs of Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, and MSBuild integration. This means that API stability for external library consumers is not a primary guarantee. The NuGet team reserves the right to introduce breaking changes in the SDK packages if necessary to enhance or modify the core tooling experience. Developers building applications that consume these SDK packages must therefore anticipate potential breaking changes between versions and incorporate rigorous testing during upgrades.1 This implies a higher potential maintenance overhead compared to libraries designed with a strict API stability contract.Historically, the SDK was distributed partly through a monolithic NuGet.Client package. However, this package is now deprecated, and the SDK has transitioned to a more granular set of packages, each focusing on a specific feature area (e.g., NuGet.Protocol, NuGet.Packaging, NuGet.Versioning). This modular approach allows developers to include only the necessary components, reducing application footprint. Due to the evolving nature of the SDK and its focus on tooling, it is strongly recommended to use the latest stable versions of the individual packages and to periodically check for deprecated dependencies. Patched versions are typically released only for critical bug or security fixes related to Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Visual Studio or the.NET SDK.Documentation for the NuGet Client SDK has also evolved. For a significant period, comprehensive, centralized documentation was limited, and developers often relied on community resources, such as specific blog posts, to understand practical usage. While these resources remain valuable, official documentation on Microsoft Learn now provides essential examples and guidance for key packages like NuGet.Protocol and NuGet.Packaging. Nevertheless, developers may still find it necessary to synthesize information from multiple sources to gain a complete understanding of implementation details.2.2. Essential NuGet SDK PackagesTo implement the required functionalities (metadata retrieval, version checking, search), several core NuGet SDK packages are essential:
NuGet.Protocol: This is the cornerstone package for interacting with NuGet feeds that adhere to the V3 API protocol, encompassing both HTTP/HTTPS endpoints (like nuget.org) and local folder-based feeds. It provides the necessary resources and APIs to perform operations such as searching for packages, fetching package metadata, listing available versions, downloading package files (.nupkg), and even pushing or deleting packages (though push/delete are outside the scope of this server).
NuGet.Packaging: This package offers APIs for interacting with the contents of NuGet package files (.nupkg) and their manifest files (.nuspec), typically from streams. While the server's primary goal might be metadata retrieval, this package is often used implicitly by NuGet.Protocol or explicitly if downloaded package contents need inspection (e.g., reading the .nuspec after downloading). It's important to note that while NuGet.Packaging can be used to create packages programmatically, Microsoft strongly recommends using official tooling (dotnet pack, nuget pack, Visual Studio) for package creation to ensure adherence to best practices.
NuGet.Versioning: This package provides types for handling Semantic Versioning (SemVer), which is fundamental to NuGet. Key types include NuGetVersion for representing specific versions and VersionRange for specifying version constraints. These are indispensable when comparing versions retrieved from a feed to determine the "latest" version or filtering versions based on ranges.
NuGet.Configuration: This library is responsible for reading and interpreting NuGet configuration settings, typically stored in nuget.config files. It allows access to defined package sources, credentials (though secure handling is complex, see Section 7), and other NuGet behaviors. While NuGet.Protocol might implicitly use configuration settings, direct use of this package might be necessary for advanced source management.
NuGet.Credentials: This package defines the data structures and models used for authentication when interacting with private or protected NuGet feeds. It works in conjunction with NuGet.Protocol to supply credentials, such as usernames and passwords (often Personal Access Tokens), to the feed.
NuGet.Common: This package contains essential utilities and interfaces shared across the NuGet SDK. It provides fundamental types frequently required by other packages, including logging abstractions (ILogger, NullLogger), cancellation support (CancellationToken), and cache management (SourceCacheContext) which helps optimize repeated requests to the same feed.
Effective utilization of the SDK necessitates combining functionalities from these granular packages. Typical operations involve creating repository and resource objects from NuGet.Protocol, using versioning types from NuGet.Versioning, potentially interacting with package data via NuGet.Packaging, and leveraging common utilities like logging and caching from NuGet.Common.2.3. Core API Operations (NuGet V3)The following outlines how to perform core NuGet feed interactions using the C# SDK, targeting the NuGet V3 API.2.3.1. Setting up Repository AccessInteraction with a NuGet feed begins by creating a SourceRepository instance. This object represents the package source (feed). The Repository.Factory.GetCoreV3 method is commonly used, taking the feed's V3 service index URL as input (e.g., https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json for the official nuget.org repository).C#using NuGet.Protocol;
using NuGet.Protocol.Core.Types;
using NuGet.Configuration;
using NuGet.Common;
using System.Threading;

//... within an async method...

ILogger logger = NullLogger.Instance;
CancellationToken cancellationToken = CancellationToken.None;
SourceCacheContext cacheContext = new SourceCacheContext(); // For caching HTTP responses

// For public feed like nuget.org
SourceRepository repository = Repository.Factory.GetCoreV3("https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json");

// For authenticated feeds, create a PackageSource with credentials (See Section 7)
// PackageSource packageSource = new PackageSource("https://private.feed/v3/index.json") {... };
// SourceRepository repository = Repository.Factory.GetCoreV3(packageSource);

2.3.2. Searching for PackagesPackage search functionality is provided by the PackageSearchResource. This resource is obtained from the SourceRepository instance.
Get Resource: PackageSearchResource searchResource = await repository.GetResourceAsync<PackageSearchResource>(cancellationToken);
Define Filter: A SearchFilter object allows specifying criteria like including pre-release versions (includePrerelease), including unlisted packages (IncludeDelisted), and filtering by compatible target frameworks (SupportedFrameworks).
Execute Search: The SearchAsync method takes the search term, filter, pagination parameters (skip, take), logger, and cancellation token.
Process Results: The method returns an IEnumerable<IPackageSearchMetadata>. Each item contains details like package ID (Identity.Id), version (Identity.Version), description, tags, download count, etc..
C#//... (repository, logger, cacheContext, cancellationToken setup)...

PackageSearchResource searchResource = await repository.GetResourceAsync<PackageSearchResource>(cancellationToken);
if (searchResource == null)
{
    // Handle case where the feed doesn't support search
    logger.LogError("This feed does not support the V3 Search resource.");
    return;
}

SearchFilter searchFilter = new SearchFilter(includePrerelease: false)
{
    // Example: Filter for.NET 6 compatibility if needed
    // SupportedFrameworks = new { ".NETCoreApp,Version=v6.0" }
};

string searchTerm = "Newtonsoft.Json";
int skip = 0;
int take = 20; // Limit results

IEnumerable<IPackageSearchMetadata> results = await searchResource.SearchAsync(
    searchTerm,
    searchFilter,
    skip,
    take,
    logger,
    cancellationToken);

foreach (IPackageSearchMetadata result in results)
{
    logger.LogInformation($"Found Package: {result.Identity.Id} Version: {result.Identity.Version}");
    logger.LogInformation($"  Description: {result.Description}");
}
**2.3.3. Retrieving Package MetadataTo get detailed metadata for all versions of a specific package, the PackageMetadataResource is used.
Get Resource: PackageMetadataResource metadataResource = await repository.GetResourceAsync<PackageMetadataResource>(cancellationToken);
Execute Query: The GetMetadataAsync method retrieves metadata. It requires the package ID and allows specifying whether to include pre-release and unlisted versions.
Process Results: It returns an IEnumerable<IPackageSearchMetadata>, similar to search results, but typically containing metadata for all known versions matching the criteria.
C#//... (repository, logger, cacheContext, cancellationToken setup)...

PackageMetadataResource metadataResource = await repository.GetResourceAsync<PackageMetadataResource>(cancellationToken);
if (metadataResource == null)
{
    logger.LogError("This feed does not support the V3 Metadata resource.");
    return;
}

string packageId = "Newtonsoft.Json";
bool includePrerelease = true;
bool includeUnlisted = false; // Typically false

IEnumerable<IPackageSearchMetadata> packages = await metadataResource.GetMetadataAsync(
    packageId,
    includePrerelease,
    includeUnlisted,
    cacheContext, // Use cache to avoid refetching
    logger,
    cancellationToken);

foreach (IPackageSearchMetadata package in packages)
{
    logger.LogInformation($"Version: {package.Identity.Version}");
    logger.LogInformation($"  Listed: {package.IsListed}");
    logger.LogInformation($"  Published: {package.Published?.ToString("o")?? "N/A"}");
    logger.LogInformation($"  Tags: {package.Tags}");
}
**2.3.4. Listing Available Package VersionsIf only the list of available versions (as NuGetVersion objects) is needed, the FindPackageByIdResource is more direct.
Get Resource: FindPackageByIdResource findPackageResource = await repository.GetResourceAsync<FindPackageByIdResource>(cancellationToken);
Execute Query: The GetAllVersionsAsync method takes the package ID and returns all known versions.
Process Results: Returns an IEnumerable<NuGetVersion>.
C#using NuGet.Versioning; // Required for NuGetVersion

//... (repository, logger, cacheContext, cancellationToken setup)...

FindPackageByIdResource findPackageResource = await repository.GetResourceAsync<FindPackageByIdResource>(cancellationToken);
if (findPackageResource == null)
{
    logger.LogError("This feed does not support the V3 FindPackageById resource.");
    return;
}

string packageId = "Newtonsoft.Json";

IEnumerable<NuGetVersion> versions = await findPackageResource.GetAllVersionsAsync(
    packageId,
    cacheContext, // Use cache
    logger,
    cancellationToken);

foreach (NuGetVersion version in versions)
{
    logger.LogInformation($"Found version: {version.ToNormalizedString()}");
    // Check if pre-release: version.IsPrerelease
}
**2.3.5. Determining Latest Package VersionsThe NuGet Client SDK provides the raw list of versions; determining the "latest" requires additional logic using the NuGet.Versioning package. After obtaining the list of NuGetVersion objects using GetAllVersionsAsync:
Filter: Remove pre-release versions if only the latest stable version is desired (!v.IsPrerelease).
Sort: Sort the versions in descending order. NuGetVersion implements IComparable.
Select: Take the first element after sorting.
C#//... (versions obtained from GetAllVersionsAsync)...

// Find latest stable version
NuGetVersion latestStableVersion = versions
 .Where(v =>!v.IsPrerelease)
 .OrderByDescending(v => v)
 .FirstOrDefault();

if (latestStableVersion!= null)
{
    logger.LogInformation($"Latest Stable Version: {latestStableVersion.ToNormalizedString()}");
}

// Find latest version (including pre-release)
NuGetVersion latestVersion = versions
 .OrderByDescending(v => v)
 .FirstOrDefault();

if (latestVersion!= null)
{
    logger.LogInformation($"Latest Version (incl. prerelease): {latestVersion.ToNormalizedString()}");
}

// Find best match within a range (e.g., latest 12.x)
VersionRange range = VersionRange.Parse("12.*");
NuGetVersion bestMatchInRange = versions
 .FindBestMatch(range, v => v); //

if (bestMatchInRange!= null)
{
     logger.LogInformation($"Best match for range '{range}': {bestMatchInRange.ToNormalizedString()}");
}

The FindBestMatch method can also be useful for finding the highest version satisfying a specific range constraint.2.3.6. Downloading Packages (Optional)While not strictly required for the core server functionality described, the SDK also allows downloading the .nupkg file itself using FindPackageByIdResource.CopyNupkgToStreamAsync. This could be useful for future extensions involving deeper package analysis.C#//... (findPackageResource, packageId, specificVersion obtained)...
// specificVersion should be a NuGetVersion instance

using (MemoryStream packageStream = new MemoryStream())
{
    bool success = await findPackageResource.CopyNupkgToStreamAsync(
        packageId,
        specificVersion,
        packageStream,
        cacheContext,
        logger,
        cancellationToken);

    if (success)
    {
        logger.LogInformation($"Successfully downloaded {packageId} {specificVersion}");
        packageStream.Position = 0;
        // Now you can use NuGet.Packaging to read the stream
        // using (var packageReader = new PackageArchiveReader(packageStream)) {... }
    }
    else
    {
        logger.LogError($"Failed to download {packageId} {specificVersion}");
    }
}
**3. Parsing.NET Project and Solution FilesA core requirement for the context server is to identify the NuGet packages referenced by a given.NET solution or project. This involves parsing .sln and .csproj files.2 Given the evolution of the .csproj format (from the older verbose style often associated with .packages.config to the leaner SDK-style format defaulting to PackageReference 8), a robust parsing mechanism is essential.3.1. Leveraging Microsoft.Build LibrariesThe most reliable and recommended approach for programmatically analyzing.NET project and solution files is to utilize the libraries provided by MSBuild itself, the build engine for.NET and Visual Studio. These libraries understand the intricacies of project evaluation, including imports, conditions, and property resolution.13 Key NuGet packages include Microsoft.Build, Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core, and crucially, Microsoft.Build.Locator.33.2. The Critical Role of Microsoft.Build.LocatorWhen running an application that uses the Microsoft.Build APIs outside of the standard MSBuild execution context (like dotnet build or a Visual Studio build), a significant challenge arises: locating the correct MSBuild assemblies, SDKs, and targets required for project evaluation. Modern development machines often have multiple MSBuild instances installed alongside different Visual Studio versions or.NET SDKs. Simply referencing the Microsoft.Build NuGet package in the server application is insufficient, as the runtime needs to load the specific MSBuild instance associated with the projects being parsed.14This is where Microsoft.Build.Locator becomes indispensable. This small utility package is designed to detect installed MSBuild instances on the machine and register one for the current process before any other Microsoft.Build types are loaded. Failure to use MSBuildLocator correctly is a common source of errors, often manifesting as InvalidProjectFileException (complaining about missing imports like Microsoft.Common.props or unrecognized tools versions) or FileNotFoundException / TypeLoadException related to MSBuild assemblies.Correct Usage Pattern:The critical aspect is to ensure MSBuildLocator.RegisterDefaults() (or RegisterInstance) is called before the application's code attempts to load or use types from the Microsoft.Build.Evaluation or Microsoft.Build.Construction namespaces. A common pattern to achieve this involves separating the locator registration from the actual MSBuild API usage into different methods:C#using Microsoft.Build.Locator;
using Microsoft.Build.Evaluation; // Or Construction
using System;
using System.Linq;

public class MsBuildInitializer
{
    private static bool _isMsBuildRegistered = false;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    public static void EnsureMsBuildRegistered()
    {
        if (_isMsBuildRegistered) return;

        lock (_lock)
        {
            if (_isMsBuildRegistered) return;

            // Attempt to register the default MSBuild instance.
            try
            {
                // Select the latest version of MSBuild installed.
                VisualStudioInstance instance = MSBuildLocator.QueryVisualStudioInstances().OrderByDescending(
                    instance => instance.Version).FirstOrDefault();

                if (instance == null)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Error: No MSBuild instance found.");
                    // Handle the error appropriately - perhaps throw an exception
                    // or log and prevent further MSBuild operations.
                    throw new InvalidOperationException("MSBuild instance could not be found.");
                }

                Console.WriteLine($"Using MSBuild version {instance.Version} from {instance.MSBuildPath}");
                MSBuildLocator.RegisterInstance(instance);
                _isMsBuildRegistered = true;
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                 Console.WriteLine($"Error registering MSBuild: {ex.Message}");
                 // Handle registration failure
                 throw;
            }
        }
    }

    // Example method that uses MSBuild APIs AFTER registration
    public static void ParseProject(string projectPath)
    {
        EnsureMsBuildRegistered(); // Ensure registration happened

        try
        {
            // Now it's safe to use MSBuild types
            var projectCollection = new ProjectCollection();
            var project = new Project(projectPath, null, null, projectCollection);
            Console.WriteLine($"Successfully loaded project: {project.FullPath}");
            //... proceed with accessing properties, items, etc....
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
             Console.WriteLine($"Error parsing project {projectPath}: {ex.Message}");
             // Handle parsing errors
        }
    }
}

// In your main application logic or service:
// MsBuildInitializer.ParseProject("path/to/your/project.csproj");
**This separation ensures the.NET runtime doesn't try to resolve Microsoft.Build types until after MSBuildLocator has configured the assembly loading paths.143.3. Parsing Solution Files (.sln)Solution files act as containers for projects. To parse a .sln file, use the static SolutionFile.Parse method from the Microsoft.Build.Construction namespace.
Input: The full path to the .sln file.15
Output: A SolutionFile object.15
Key Information: The SolutionFile object provides access to the projects listed in the solution via the ProjectsInOrder property. This returns a collection of ProjectInSolution objects, each containing details like ProjectName, RelativePath, AbsolutePath, ProjectGuid, and ProjectType.
C#using Microsoft.Build.Construction;
using System;
using System.IO;

//... EnsureMsBuildRegistered() called previously...

string solutionPath = "path/to/your/solution.sln";

try
{
    if (!File.Exists(solutionPath))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: Solution file not found at {solutionPath}");
        return;
    }

    SolutionFile solutionFile = SolutionFile.Parse(solutionPath); // [15]

    Console.WriteLine($"Parsed Solution: {solutionPath}");
    Console.WriteLine("Projects in solution:");

    foreach (ProjectInSolution projectInSolution in solutionFile.ProjectsInOrder) // [15]
    {
        // Filter out solution folders, etc. if needed based on ProjectTypeGuid
        if (projectInSolution.ProjectType == SolutionProjectType.KnownToBeMSBuildFormat)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  Project Name: {projectInSolution.ProjectName}");
            Console.WriteLine($"    Relative Path: {projectInSolution.RelativePath}");
            Console.WriteLine($"    Absolute Path: {projectInSolution.AbsolutePath}"); // Useful for loading the project [15]
            Console.WriteLine($"    GUID: {projectInSolution.ProjectGuid}");
        }
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error parsing solution {solutionPath}: {ex.Message}");
    // Handle exceptions
}
**3.4. Parsing Project Files (.csproj)Two primary approaches exist using Microsoft.Build libraries for parsing .csproj files:

Full Evaluation (Microsoft.Build.Evaluation.Project): This approach loads the project file and performs a full MSBuild evaluation. It resolves properties, processes imports (like SDK targets), evaluates conditions, and computes the final set of items (including PackageReference) based on the project's logic and the specified configuration. This is the most comprehensive way to understand a project's dependencies as they would be seen by an actual build.

Loading: Requires a ProjectCollection (often ProjectCollection.GlobalProjectCollection) and the project file path. Global properties (e.g., Configuration=Release, Platform=AnyCPU) can be passed to influence evaluation, which is crucial if package references are conditional.
Access: Provides access to evaluated properties (GetPropertyValue, Properties) and evaluated items (GetItems).

C#using Microsoft.Build.Evaluation;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;

//... EnsureMsBuildRegistered() called previously...

string projectPath = "path/to/your/project.csproj"; // Obtained from SolutionFile.Parse or direct input

try
{
    if (!File.Exists(projectPath))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: Project file not found at {projectPath}");
        return;
    }

    // Optional: Define global properties if needed for conditional evaluation
    var globalProperties = new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        // { "Configuration", "Release" },
        // { "Platform", "AnyCPU" }
    };

    var projectCollection = ProjectCollection.GlobalProjectCollection; // Or new ProjectCollection() [16]

    // Load and evaluate the project
    Project project = new Project(projectPath, globalProperties, null, projectCollection); // [17]

    Console.WriteLine($"Loaded Project: {project.FullPath}");
    Console.WriteLine($"  TargetFramework: {project.GetPropertyValue("TargetFramework")}"); // [17]

    // Extract PackageReferences (see Section 3.5)
    var packageReferences = project.GetItems("PackageReference"); // [17]
    foreach (var reference in packageReferences)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"    Package: {reference.EvaluatedInclude} Version: {reference.GetMetadataValue("Version")}"); // [17]
    }

    // Unload the project when done if necessary (especially if not using GlobalProjectCollection)
    // projectCollection.UnloadProject(project); [16]
}
catch (Microsoft.Build.Exceptions.InvalidProjectFileException ex) // [17]
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error loading/evaluating project {projectPath}: {ex.BaseMessage}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error processing project {projectPath}: {ex.Message}");
}

**


Raw XML Parsing (Microsoft.Build.Construction.ProjectRootElement): This approach parses the .csproj file as an XML document without performing a full evaluation. It provides direct access to the elements and attributes as defined in the file itself. This is generally faster than full evaluation but does not resolve imports, conditions, or properties.

Loading: Use the static ProjectRootElement.Open(projectPath) method.
Access: Provides collections like Properties, ItemGroups, and Items. Values accessed are the unevaluated strings present in the XML.

C#using Microsoft.Build.Construction;
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;

//... EnsureMsBuildRegistered() might not be strictly required if only using Construction
// but is good practice if any Evaluation might occur later.

string projectPath = "path/to/your/project.csproj";

try
{
    if (!File.Exists(projectPath))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: Project file not found at {projectPath}");
        return;
    }

    ProjectRootElement projectRootElement = ProjectRootElement.Open(projectPath); // [18]

    Console.WriteLine($"Parsed Project XML: {projectPath}");

    // Example: Read TargetFramework property (unevaluated)
    string targetFramework = projectRootElement.Properties // [18]
                              .FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == "TargetFramework")?.Value;
    Console.WriteLine($"  TargetFramework (from XML): {targetFramework}");

    // Extract PackageReferences (see Section 3.5)
    var packageReferences = projectRootElement.Items.Where(item => item.ItemType == "PackageReference"); // [18]
    foreach (var reference in packageReferences)
    {
        string version = reference.Metadata.FirstOrDefault(m => m.Name == "Version")?.Value; // [18]
        Console.WriteLine($"    Package: {reference.Include} Version (from XML): {version}"); // [18]
    }
}
catch (Microsoft.Build.Exceptions.InvalidProjectFileException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error parsing project XML {projectPath}: {ex.BaseMessage}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error processing project XML {projectPath}: {ex.Message}");
}

**

The choice between Project and ProjectRootElement involves a trade-off. Project provides the most accurate view of dependencies after considering the full project logic (imports, conditions, SDK defaults) but incurs the cost of evaluation. ProjectRootElement is faster for accessing raw XML data but requires the consuming application to manually handle complexities like conditions or Central Package Management if the unevaluated data is insufficient. For reliably determining the effective set of package references and their versions, especially in complex solutions, Project evaluation is generally preferred.3.5. Extracting PackageReference DetailsOnce a project is loaded (either via Project or ProjectRootElement), the PackageReference items can be extracted 8:

Using Project (Evaluated):

Call project.GetItems("PackageReference") to get a collection of ProjectItem objects.
The package ID is in item.EvaluatedInclude.17
The resolved version (considering CPM, conditions, etc.) is obtained using item.GetMetadataValue("Version"). This reliably provides the version that MSBuild determined should be used.



Using ProjectRootElement (Raw XML):

Iterate through projectRootElement.ItemGroups.SelectMany(g => g.Items).
Filter where item.ItemType == "PackageReference".
The package ID is in the item.Include attribute.8
The version, as written in the .csproj file, is accessed via item.Metadata.FirstOrDefault(m => m.Name == "Version")?.Value.8
Central Package Management (CPM) Consideration: If CPM is enabled (indicated by the <ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally> property, typically in a Directory.Build.props file), the Version attribute might be missing from the <PackageReference> element in the .csproj file. Parsing with ProjectRootElement alone will not yield the version in this case. The application would need additional logic to locate and parse the Directory.Packages.props file to find the corresponding <PackageVersion Include="..." Version="..." /> element.19 Using Project.GetItems avoids this complexity as the evaluation process resolves the version from the CPM file.
Conditional References: Project.GetItems automatically filters items based on conditions evaluated against the provided global properties.9 When using ProjectRootElement, the Condition attribute on the item or its parent ItemGroup must be manually parsed and evaluated if conditional inclusion logic is required.8

Handling Project FormatsThe Microsoft.Build libraries are designed to handle both the older, non-SDK style .csproj files and the modern SDK-style projects.9 While the internal structure differs (e.g., explicit file includes vs. globbing), the PackageReference mechanism is the primary focus for this server application.8 Projects still using the legacy packages.config format would need to be migrated to PackageReference to be fully analyzed by this server, although detecting the presence of packages.config could be added as a separate feature.83.7. Comparison of Project/Solution Parsing ApproachesWhile Microsoft.Build is recommended, other approaches exist. The following table compares the main options:
ApproachLibrary/ClassProsConsUse CaseMSBuild Solution ParsingMicrosoft.Build.Construction.SolutionFileOfficial, understands .sln structure, provides project paths/GUIDs.Only parses solution structure, doesn't evaluate projects. Requires MSBuildLocator.Getting the list of projects within a solution.MSBuild Project EvaluationMicrosoft.Build.Evaluation.ProjectOfficial, handles SDKs, imports, conditions, CPM. Provides accurate evaluated dependencies.Slower than raw parsing, requires MSBuildLocator, can be complex to configure correctly (global props).Getting the effective list of dependencies and properties as seen by a build.MSBuild Raw Project ParsingMicrosoft.Build.Construction.ProjectRootElementOfficial, faster than evaluation, direct XML access.Doesn't resolve imports, conditions, CPM. Requires manual handling of these complexities. May not need MSBuildLocator.Simple, fast extraction of basic properties/items when full evaluation is unnecessary.Third-Party Parsers (e.g., MvsSln)MvsSlnPotentially simpler API for specific tasks. May wrap Microsoft.Build.External dependency, maintenance/support depends on author, may lag behind MSBuild features/changes. Potential licensing concerns.When a simpler abstraction is desired and the trade-offs are acceptable.Manual Regex/XML ParsingSystem.Text.RegularExpressions, System.Xml.LinqNo external dependencies beyond.NET BCL.Extremely brittle, difficult to maintain, cannot handle MSBuild logic (imports, conditions, SDKs), error-prone. 4Strongly discouraged for .csproj/.sln files due to their complexity and reliance on MSBuild logic.
Given the need to accurately determine package references, potentially considering conditions and Central Package Management, the combination of SolutionFile.Parse and Project evaluation is the most robust approach, despite the requirement for careful MSBuildLocator setup.4. Building the Server Backend with the.NET Generic Host and MCP SDKSince the primary interface for this server is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we will use the.NET Generic Host directly, rather than the ASP.NET Core Web API templates. The MCP C# SDK integrates seamlessly with the Generic Host.4.1. Framework RationaleThe.NET Generic Host provides a standard way to bootstrap applications, managing configuration, logging, and dependency injection. It's suitable for console applications, background services, and, in this case, an MCP server communicating via stdio.
Standardization: Provides a consistent application startup and lifetime management model.
Configuration: Integrates with the standard.NET configuration system (appsettings.json, environment variables, etc.).
Dependency Injection: Includes a built-in DI container.
Logging: Integrates with standard.NET logging abstractions.
MCP SDK Integration: The ModelContextProtocol C# SDK is designed to work directly with the Generic Host.
4.2. Project SetupStart by creating a new console application project:Bashdotnet new console --name NuGetContextMcpServer
cd NuGetContextMcpServer
dotnet add package ModelContextProtocol --prerelease #
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting # Included by default in newer templates, but good to ensure
# Add other necessary packages (NuGet Client SDK, MSBuild.Locator, etc.)
dotnet add package Microsoft.Build.Locator
dotnet add package Microsoft.Build # Add other MSBuild packages as needed
dotnet add package NuGet.Protocol # Add other NuGet SDK packages as needed
**4.3. Configuring the MCP Server (Program.cs)The Program.cs file is where the host is built, services are registered, and the MCP server is configured.C#using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using ModelContextProtocol.Extensions.Hosting; // Required for MCP extensions [20]
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure; // Assuming MCP tools are here
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Application; // Assuming service interfaces are here
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure.NuGet; // Assuming NuGet client wrapper is here
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure.Parsing; // Assuming MSBuild parser is here

// --- MSBuild Locator Registration ---
// IMPORTANT: Ensure MSBuild is registered *before* any MSBuild types are loaded.
// This might involve a separate static class/method called early.
MsBuildInitializer.EnsureMsBuildRegistered(); //
// --- End MSBuild Locator Registration ---

var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args); //

// --- Configure Logging ---
builder.Logging.ClearProviders();
builder.Logging.AddConsole(); // Or other providers

// --- Configure Application Services (DI) ---
// Register your application services and infrastructure components
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IProjectParser, MsBuildProjectParser>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ISolutionParser, MsBuildSolutionParser>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<INuGetQueryService, NuGetClientWrapper>(); // Register NuGet interaction service
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IProjectAnalysisService, ProjectAnalysisService>(); // Register core analysis service
// Add other services (caching, etc.) if needed

// --- Configure MCP Server ---
builder.Services.AddMcpServer() //
   .WithStdioServerTransport() // Use stdio for communication
   .WithToolsFromAssembly(typeof(NuGetTools).Assembly); // Register tools from the assembly containing NuGetTools

// --- Build and Run Host ---
var host = builder.Build();
await host.RunAsync(); //
**This setup performs the following:
MSBuild Initialization: Crucially calls MsBuildInitializer.EnsureMsBuildRegistered() before the host builder might load MSBuild types implicitly or explicitly.
Host Creation: Creates a default application host builder.
Logging: Configures basic console logging.
Dependency Injection: Registers application-specific services (parsing, NuGet querying, analysis logic) with the DI container.
MCP Server Configuration:

Registers the necessary MCP server services using AddMcpServer().
Configures the server to use standard input/output (stdio) for communication using WithStdioServerTransport(). This is the primary transport mechanism supported by the SDK for servers.
Registers the MCP tools (defined in Section 5) using WithToolsFromAssembly(), which scans the specified assembly for classes and methods marked with MCP attributes.


Host Execution: Builds and runs the host asynchronously.
4.4. Dependency Injection (DI)The Generic Host provides a built-in DI container, similar to ASP.NET Core.
Registration: Services are registered in Program.cs using builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>(), AddScoped, or AddTransient.1
Injection: Registered services can be injected into the constructors of other registered services or directly into MCP tool methods.
4.5. ConfigurationConfiguration follows the standard.NET patterns, primarily using appsettings.json.
Access: Use IConfiguration (available via builder.Configuration) or the Options pattern (IOptions<T>) by configuring options in Program.cs (builder.Services.Configure<MyOptions>(...)) and injecting IOptions<MyOptions> into services.
5. Defining Model Context Protocol (MCP) ToolsInstead of traditional API endpoints, an MCP server exposes its functionality as "tools" that an MCP client (like an LLM agent) can invoke.5.1. Tool DefinitionTools are defined as static methods within classes:
Tool Type Attribute: The class containing the tool methods must be decorated with the `` attribute.
Tool Attribute: Each method intended as a tool must be decorated with the `` attribute. A Description should be provided to help the LLM understand the tool's purpose.
Parameters: Method parameters correspond to the arguments the LLM will provide. Use [Description] attributes on parameters for clarity.
Dependency Injection: Services registered in Program.cs (like IProjectAnalysisService, INuGetQueryService) can be injected directly as parameters into the static tool methods.
Return Value: The method's return value is serialized (typically to JSON) and sent back to the MCP client as the tool's result.
5.2. Example Tool Definitions (NuGetTools.cs)This class would typically reside in the Infrastructure layer (see Section 12).C#using ModelContextProtocol.Attributes; // [20]
using System.ComponentModel;
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Application; // For service interfaces
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Api.DTOs; // Assuming DTOs are defined for return types

namespace NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure.Mcp;

// Mark the class as containing MCP tools

public static class NuGetTools
{
    // Define the project analysis tool
   
   
    public static async Task<IEnumerable<AnalyzedDependency>> AnalyzeProjectDependenciesAsync(
        string projectPath,
        IProjectAnalysisService analysisService, // Service injected via DI
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Delegate the actual work to the application service layer
        return await analysisService.AnalyzeProjectAsync(projectPath, cancellationToken);
    }

    // Define the package search tool
   
   
    public static async Task<IEnumerable<PackageSearchResult>> SearchNuGetPackagesAsync(
        string searchTerm,
        [Description("Whether to include pre-release package versions in the search results.")] bool includePrerelease,
        IPackageSearchService searchService, // Service injected via DI
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Delegate to the application service layer
        return await searchService.SearchPackagesAsync(searchTerm, includePrerelease, cancellationToken);
    }

    // Define the package versions tool
   
    [Description("Lists all available versions for a specific NuGet package ID from the configured feed.")]
    public static async Task<IEnumerable<string>> GetNuGetPackageVersionsAsync(
        string packageId,
        [Description("Whether to include pre-release package versions.")] bool includePrerelease,
        IPackageVersionService versionService, // Service injected via DI
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Delegate to the application service layer
        return await versionService.GetPackageVersionsAsync(packageId, includePrerelease, cancellationToken);
    }

     // Define the latest package version tool
   
    [Description("Gets the latest version (stable or including pre-release) for a specific NuGet package ID.")]
    public static async Task<PackageVersionInfo?> GetLatestNuGetPackageVersionAsync(
        string packageId,
        bool includePrerelease,
        IPackageVersionService versionService, // Service injected via DI
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Delegate to the application service layer
        return await versionService.GetLatestPackageVersionAsync(packageId, includePrerelease, cancellationToken);
    }

    // Define DTOs (or place them in a shared DTOs project/folder)
    // These should match the return types of the tool methods
    public record AnalyzedDependency(string Id, string RequestedVersion, string? LatestStableVersion, string? LatestVersion);
    public record PackageSearchResult(string Id, string Version, string Description, string? ProjectUrl);
    public record PackageVersionInfo(string PackageId, string LatestVersion);
}

**These tools directly map the core functionalities (project analysis, package search, version listing) identified earlier, making them available for invocation via the MCP protocol. The actual logic resides within the injected application services, maintaining separation of concerns.6. Integrating Application ComponentsStructuring the application effectively is key to managing complexity and ensuring maintainability. A layered or service-oriented approach is recommended, leveraging the Generic Host's dependency injection.6.1. Architectural OverviewA logical separation of concerns can be achieved with the following layers (see Section 12 for project layout):
MCP Server Layer (Presentation/Host):

Components: Program.cs (Generic Host setup), MCP Tool Definitions (NuGetTools.cs).
Responsibilities: Bootstrapping the application, configuring DI and logging, defining MCP tools, handling MCP communication (via SDK and stdio transport).


Service Layer (Application Logic):

Components: Interfaces (e.g., IProjectAnalysisService, IPackageSearchService, IPackageVersionService) and their implementations.
Responsibilities: Orchestrating the core business logic, coordinating calls to infrastructure components (parsing, NuGet queries), mapping data between infrastructure results and tool return types/DTOs. Services are injected into MCP tool methods.


Infrastructure Layer (Data Access & External Services):

Components: Concrete implementations for interacting with external systems or low-level details. Examples: MsBuildProjectParser (using Microsoft.Build), NuGetClientWrapper (using NuGet.Protocol), caching implementations (IMemoryCache, IDistributedCache).
Responsibilities: Encapsulating the specifics of file parsing, NuGet API communication, caching logic. These implementations are injected into the service layer.


This separation isolates distinct complexities. The service layer doesn't need to know the specifics of MSBuildLocator or NuGet feed authentication; it just uses the defined infrastructure interfaces. The MCP tools in the Infrastructure layer act as simple entry points that delegate work to the Service layer.6.2. Request Workflow Example (MCP Tool Invocation)Illustrating how an MCP tool invocation flows through the architecture:
MCP Client: An LLM agent (acting as an MCP client) decides to call the AnalyzeProjectDependenciesAsync tool with a specific projectPath.
MCP Server (Host): The MCP C# SDK receives the tool call request via the configured transport (stdio).
MCP Server (SDK): The SDK identifies the corresponding static tool method (NuGetTools.AnalyzeProjectDependenciesAsync) based on the tool name.
MCP Server (DI): The SDK uses the application's DI container to resolve the required service dependencies for the tool method (in this case, IProjectAnalysisService).
MCP Server (Tool Execution): The SDK invokes the static AnalyzeProjectDependenciesAsync method, passing the projectPath argument from the request and the resolved analysisService instance.
Infrastructure Layer (Tool): The AnalyzeProjectDependenciesAsync tool method immediately calls analysisService.AnalyzeProjectAsync(projectPath, cancellationToken).
Service Layer: ProjectAnalysisService coordinates calls to _solutionParser / _projectParser (Infrastructure) and _nugetQueryService (Infrastructure) as detailed in the previous report's workflow (Section 6.2.1).
Infrastructure Layer (Parsing/NuGet): MsBuild...Parser and NuGetClientWrapper perform the actual file parsing and NuGet feed interactions.
Service Layer: ProjectAnalysisService aggregates results into AnalyzedDependency objects.
Service Layer: Returns IEnumerable<AnalyzedDependency> back to the tool method.
Infrastructure Layer (Tool): The AnalyzeProjectDependenciesAsync method returns the result.
MCP Server (SDK): The SDK serializes the return value (IEnumerable<AnalyzedDependency>) into the MCP response format (likely JSON).
MCP Server (Host): The SDK sends the serialized response back to the client via the stdio transport.
MCP Client: Receives and processes the tool result.
6.3. Managing State and DependenciesDependency Injection is central to managing service lifetimes and dependencies.
Services like ProjectAnalysisService or NuGetClientWrapper should typically be registered as Singleton or Scoped (though scoping is less relevant in a stdio-based console host compared to a web server handling multiple requests concurrently). Singleton is often appropriate for stateless services or services managing shared resources like caches.
The ProjectCollection used by Microsoft.Build.Evaluation.Project might be managed within a service, potentially requiring careful handling of its lifetime.
MCP tool methods themselves are static but receive dependencies via parameter injection resolved by the DI container for each call.
7. Handling NuGet Feeds and Authentication(This section remains largely unchanged but emphasizes configuration within the Generic Host context)The server must be able to interact with both public (like nuget.org) and private NuGet feeds, the latter often requiring authentication. Securely managing credentials for private feeds is paramount.7.1. Configuring Package SourcesThe server application needs explicit configuration for the NuGet feed URL(s) it should target. This configuration should be managed via the.NET configuration system (e.g., appsettings.json) and accessed using the Options pattern within registered services.JSON// Example appsettings.json section
"NuGetSettings": {
  "QueryFeedUrl": "https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json", // Default to public feed
  // "QueryFeedUrl": "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/myorg/_packaging/myfeed/nuget/v3/index.json", // Example private feed
  "Username": "user-from-secrets-or-env", // For private feed
  "PasswordOrPat": "pat-from-secrets-or-env" // For private feed
}
Register the options in Program.cs:C#// In Program.cs
builder.Services.Configure<NuGetSettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("NuGetSettings"));
**7.2. Interacting with Public vs. Private Feeds
Public Feeds (e.g., nuget.org): Generally do not require authentication. The SourceRepository can be created directly with the public V3 index URL.
Private Feeds (e.g., Azure Artifacts, GitHub Packages): Almost always require authentication.
7.3. Secure Credential Management StrategiesStoring credentials directly in appsettings.json must be avoided. Recommended strategies include:
Personal Access Tokens (PATs): Generate PATs from the feed provider and use them as the password. Store PATs securely using:

.NET User Secrets: For local development only.22 Managed via dotnet user-secrets set.
Environment Variables: Suitable for servers and CI/CD pipelines.
Azure Key Vault / Cloud Secret Manager: Best practice for production environments.23


Programmatic Authentication: Load the securely stored credentials (PAT) via IConfiguration / IOptions<T> and pass them to NuGet.Protocol using PackageSourceCredential. (See code example in the previous report's Section 7.3).
Credential Providers: While powerful for interactive use, direct programmatic integration with NuGet.Protocol is complex and generally not recommended for server applications due to lack of straightforward SDK support.
Recommendation: Use PATs stored securely (User Secrets for dev, Environment Variables/Key Vault for prod) and loaded via the Options pattern, then passed programmatically to PackageSourceCredential.7.4. Comparison of Secure Credential Handling Methods(Table remains the same as in the previous report's Section 7.4)

8. Error Handling and ResilienceRobust error handling is crucial, especially in an application interacting with file systems, external networks (NuGet feeds), and potentially complex protocols like MCP.8.1. Identifying Potential Failure Points
Network Issues: Failure connecting to NuGet feeds.
NuGet Feed Errors: Feed unavailable, rate limiting, package issues.
Authentication Failures: Invalid/expired PATs.
Parsing Errors: File not found, invalid format, MSBuild environment issues.
MCP Errors: Issues during tool invocation, serialization, or transport.
Internal Server Errors: Uncaught exceptions in service logic.
8.2. Global Exception Handling in the Generic HostWhile ASP.NET Core's IExceptionHandler is tied to the HTTP pipeline, a similar global approach can be used in the Generic Host, often by wrapping the main execution logic or handling exceptions surfaced by the host itself. However, for an MCP server primarily interacting via stdio, exceptions within tool execution need careful handling to return appropriate error information back through the MCP protocol if possible, or log failures robustly.Strategy:
Tool-Level try-catch: Wrap the core logic within each MCP tool method in a try-catch block.
Log Thoroughly: Inside the catch block, use the injected ILogger to log the full exception details.
Return Meaningful Errors (if possible via MCP): The MCP protocol might define ways to return structured errors. If the ModelContextProtocol SDK supports this, construct and return an appropriate error response. If not, the tool might have to return a simple failure indicator or throw an exception that the MCP host might log. Currently, the specifics of standardized error returns via MCP tools in the C# SDK require further investigation or SDK evolution.
Host-Level Logging: Ensure the Generic Host's logging is configured to capture any unhandled exceptions that might crash the server process itself.
C#// Example within an MCP Tool Method

[Description("Analyzes...")]
public static async Task<object> AnalyzeProjectDependenciesAsync(
    string projectPath,
    IProjectAnalysisService analysisService,
    ILogger<NuGetTools> logger, // Inject logger
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    try
    {
        var results = await analysisService.AnalyzeProjectAsync(projectPath, cancellationToken);
        return results; // Return success DTO
    }
    catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
    {
        logger.LogError(ex, "Project or solution file not found at path: {Path}", projectPath);
        // TODO: Return MCP-specific error structure if possible, otherwise indicate failure.
        // Example: return new McpErrorResult("FileNotFound", $"File not found: {projectPath}");
        throw; // Or rethrow if MCP doesn't handle structured errors well yet
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        logger.LogError(ex, "An unexpected error occurred during project analysis for path: {Path}", projectPath);
        // TODO: Return generic MCP error
        throw; // Or rethrow
    }
}
8.3. Logging Strategies
Use ILogger<T>: Inject ILogger<T> into services and MCP tool definitions.
Log Exceptions: Log full exception details within catch blocks.
Contextual Information: Include relevant context (tool name, parameters) with logs.
Configure Providers: Set up appropriate logging providers (Console, File, etc.) in Program.cs.
8.4. Resilience Patterns (Polly)For NuGet feed interactions, consider using Polly for retries or circuit breakers to handle transient network issues.9. Performance ConsiderationsOptimizing performance involves minimizing latency from external calls and potentially speeding up parsing.9.1. Caching NuGet API ResponsesSince this isn't a standard web API with HTTP endpoints, ASP.NET Core Output Caching isn't directly applicable. Instead, use in-memory or distributed caching within the NuGetClientWrapper or the application services that consume it.

In-Memory Caching (IMemoryCache):

Concept: Caches data within the server's memory.28
Best Fit: Caching results of NuGet API calls (versions, search results, metadata) within the NuGetClientWrapper service. Suitable for single-instance deployments.
Setup: Register with builder.Services.AddMemoryCache(). Inject IMemoryCache into the service that needs caching.28
Usage: Use _cache.GetOrCreateAsync() with appropriate cache keys (e.g., based on package ID and prerelease flag) and expiration policies (absolute or sliding).28



Distributed Caching (IDistributedCache):

Concept: Caches data in an external shared store (e.g., Redis).
Best Fit: Necessary if the MCP server might be scaled to multiple instances (though less common for stdio-based servers) or if cache persistence beyond process lifetime is needed.
Setup: Install and configure a provider (e.g., Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis). Register in Program.cs. Inject IDistributedCache.
Usage: Requires manual serialization/deserialization (often to JSON) before storing/retrieving.


Recommendation: Start with IMemoryCache within the NuGetClientWrapper service to cache responses from GetAllVersionsAsync, GetMetadataAsync, and SearchAsync.9.2. Optimizing Project File ParsingParsing .csproj and .sln files, especially using full MSBuild evaluation, can be resource-intensive.31
Caching Parsed Data: Cache the results of AnalyzeProjectAsync using IMemoryCache within the ProjectAnalysisService. Use the project/solution file path as part of the cache key. Invalidate based on a time-to-live (TTL) or potentially file modification timestamps (though checking timestamps adds I/O).
ProjectRootElement vs. Project: If full evaluation (Project) proves too slow and the complexities it handles (imports, conditions, CPM resolution) aren't strictly necessary for all use cases, consider using the faster ProjectRootElement parsing for simpler scenarios.
MSBuild Static Graph API: For very large solutions where evaluation is a bottleneck, investigate MSBuild's Static Graph APIs (RestoreUseStaticGraphEvaluation=true property) for potentially faster dependency graph analysis, although programmatic use outside of restore is advanced.19
Hardware: Ensure the server runs on hardware with fast SSD storage and sufficient RAM.31
10. Testing Strategy with NUnitA comprehensive testing strategy is essential for ensuring the reliability of the MCP server, covering parsing logic, NuGet interactions, and tool behavior. NUnit is a popular and feature-rich framework for.NET testing.10.1. Unit TestingUnit tests focus on testing individual components (classes, methods) in isolation from their dependencies. This is achieved using mocking frameworks like Moq.
Test Project Structure: Create separate NUnit test projects for each layer that contains testable logic (e.g., NuGetContextMcpServer.Application.Tests, NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure.Tests).
NUnit Basics:

Use `` attribute on test classes.
Use `` attribute on test methods.
Use `` for code to run before each test (e.g., initializing mocks).
Use Assert methods (e.g., Assert.AreEqual, Assert.IsTrue, Assert.Throws) or FluentAssertions for verification.
Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern.


Mocking Dependencies (Moq):

Install the Moq NuGet package.
Create mocks of interfaces: var mockRepository = new Mock<INuGetQueryService>();.
Set up mock behavior: mockRepository.Setup(r => r.SearchAsync(It.IsAny<string>(), It.IsAny<bool>(), It.IsAny<CancellationToken>())).ReturnsAsync(expectedSearchResults);.
Inject mocked objects into the constructor of the class under test (SUT).
Verify interactions: mockRepository.Verify(r => r.SearchAsync("test", false, It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()), Times.Once);.


Testing Services (Application Layer):

Mock infrastructure interfaces (IProjectParser, INuGetQueryService, etc.).
Instantiate the service class (e.g., ProjectAnalysisService) with the mocked dependencies.
Call the service method being tested.
Assert the return value and/or verify that the correct methods were called on the mocks.


Testing Infrastructure Components:

NuGetClientWrapper: Testing interactions with NuGet.Protocol can be complex. Options include:

Wrapping NuGet.Protocol resources (PackageSearchResource, etc.) in interfaces and mocking those interfaces (high effort).
Creating integration tests that hit a local NuGet feed or a controlled test feed.
Focusing tests on the logic around the SDK calls (e.g., credential handling, result mapping, caching logic) by mocking the SDK resources themselves if feasible, or accepting lower unit test coverage for direct SDK interaction points.


MsBuild Parsers: Testing code that uses Microsoft.Build often requires integration tests due to the reliance on the MSBuild environment and MSBuildLocator. Unit testing might focus on helper methods that don't directly invoke MSBuild evaluation.


Testing MCP Tools:

Since tools are static methods with injected dependencies, testing focuses on the services they delegate to.
You could create a test host using Host.CreateApplicationBuilder configured with mocked services, then somehow invoke the tool registration and execution logic provided by the MCP SDK's test utilities (if available) or manually simulate the DI resolution and static method call. However, focusing unit tests on the underlying IProjectAnalysisService, IPackageSearchService, etc., is generally more practical and effective. Testing the static tool methods themselves often becomes closer to integration testing.
Note: Directly mocking static methods is generally discouraged and often requires specialized tools or refactoring the static methods to wrap instance-based logic. Prefer testing the injected dependencies.


Example NUnit Test (Application Service):C#using NUnit.Framework;
using Moq;
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Application;
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure.NuGet; // For INuGetQueryService
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure.Parsing; // For IProjectParser etc.

using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Threading;
using NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure.Mcp; // For DTOs

    private Mock<INuGetQueryService> _mockNuGetQueryService;
    private ProjectAnalysisService _sut; // System Under Test

   
    public void Setup()
    {
        _mockSolutionParser = new Mock<ISolutionParser>();
        _mockProjectParser = new Mock<IProjectParser>();
        _mockNuGetQueryService = new Mock<INuGetQueryService>();

        // Instantiate the service with mocked dependencies
        _sut = new ProjectAnalysisService(
            _mockSolutionParser.Object,
            _mockProjectParser.Object,
            _mockNuGetQueryService.Object);
    }

   
    public async Task AnalyzeProjectAsync_ValidProject_ReturnsAnalyzedDependencies()
    {
        // Arrange
        string projectPath = "path/to/project.csproj";
        var parsedRefs = new List<ParsedPackageReference>
        {
            new ParsedPackageReference("Newtonsoft.Json", "12.0.1"),
            new ParsedPackageReference("Microsoft.Extensions.Logging", "6.0.0")
        };
        var newtonsoftVersions = new List<NuGetVersion> { NuGetVersion.Parse("12.0.1"), NuGetVersion.Parse("13.0.1") };
        var loggingVersions = new List<NuGetVersion> { NuGetVersion.Parse("6.0.0"), NuGetVersion.Parse("7.0.0") };

        _mockProjectParser.Setup(p => p.GetPackageReferencesAsync(projectPath, It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()))
                         .ReturnsAsync(parsedRefs);

        _mockNuGetQueryService.Setup(n => n.GetAllVersionsAsync("Newtonsoft.Json", It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()))
                             .ReturnsAsync(newtonsoftVersions);

**10.2. Integration TestingIntegration tests verify that multiple components of the application work together correctly. For this MCP server, integration tests could involve:
Testing Parsing: Creating test .csproj and .sln files and verifying that the MsBuildProjectParser / MsBuildSolutionParser correctly extracts information. This requires careful setup of the MSBuild environment, potentially using WebApplicationFactory if hosted within an ASP.NET Core test host context (less common for a pure MCP server) or managing the MSBuild environment directly.
Testing NuGet Interaction: Testing against a local, self-hosted NuGet feed (like BaGet) populated with test packages.
Testing MCP Tools End-to-End: Setting up a test host, potentially using the MCP SDK's client components (McpClientFactory) to connect to the test server (running in-process or separately) and invoke tools, verifying the results. This is the most comprehensive but also the most complex type of test to set up.
Recommendation: Focus heavily on unit tests with mocking for the Application layer. Add targeted integration tests for critical Infrastructure components like parsing complex project files or authenticating with specific private NuGet feeds. Full end-to-end MCP testing might be reserved for specific critical paths due to complexity.11. Recommended Project LayoutA clean and well-defined project structure is crucial for maintainability, testability, and scalability. Based on the layered architecture (Section 6.1) and incorporating testing projects, the following layout within a single Visual Studio Solution (.sln) is recommended:
NuGetContextMcpServer.sln (Solution File)

src/ (Solution Folder)

NuGetContextMcpServer.Host/ (Console Application Project -.NET Generic Host)

Program.cs: Configures Generic Host, DI, logging, MCP server, tool registration.
appsettings.json, appsettings.Development.json, etc.: Configuration files.
(Depends on NuGetContextMcpServer.Application, NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure)


NuGetContextMcpServer.Application/ (Class Library Project)

Interfaces/: Defines service interfaces (e.g., IProjectAnalysisService.cs, IPackageSearchService.cs).
Services/: Contains implementations of the service interfaces (e.g., ProjectAnalysisService.cs). Orchestrates calls to Infrastructure.
(Depends on NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure - or only its interfaces if defined separately)


NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure/ (Class Library Project)

Parsing/: Implementations for parsing (e.g., MsBuildProjectParser.cs, MsBuildSolutionParser.cs, MsBuildInitializer.cs).
NuGet/: Implementations for NuGet interaction (e.g., NuGetClientWrapper.cs).
Mcp/: Contains MCP tool definitions (e.g., NuGetTools.cs). Includes DTOs used by tools (or place DTOs in a shared Common or Contracts project).
Caching/ (Optional): Caching implementations.
(References Microsoft.Build.Locator, Microsoft.Build, NuGet.Protocol, ModelContextProtocol, Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory, etc.)


NuGetContextMcpServer.Domain/ (Optional Class Library Project)

Core domain entities or shared value objects, if needed. Might be minimal.




tests/ (Solution Folder)

NuGetContextMcpServer.Application.Tests/ (NUnit Test Project)

Unit tests for the Service Layer (e.g., ProjectAnalysisServiceTests.cs). Mocks Infrastructure dependencies.


NuGetContextMcpServer.Infrastructure.Tests/ (NUnit Test Project)

Unit/Integration tests for Infrastructure components (e.g., testing specific parsing logic, NuGet client helper methods, potentially integration tests against local feeds/files).


(Optional) NuGetContextMcpServer.Host.Tests/ (Integration Test Project)

End-to-end tests invoking MCP tools via a test client against an in-process or hosted test server. More complex to set up.






Benefits of this Layout:
Clear Separation: Isolates hosting/presentation (MCP), business logic (Application), and external interactions (Infrastructure).
Testability: Facilitates focused unit testing of Application and Infrastructure layers by mocking dependencies.
Maintainability: Changes are localized; modifications to NuGet interaction logic don't directly affect Application services if interfaces are stable.
DI Alignment: Structure naturally supports registering implementations against interfaces in Program.cs.
12. Conclusion and Recommendations12.1. Summary of Key TechnologiesThis report has outlined a technical blueprint for building a C# Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to provide context about NuGet dependencies within.NET projects to LLMs. The recommended technology stack includes:
Core Language/Framework: C# and the.NET Generic Host.
MCP Integration: The official ModelContextProtocol C# SDK (preview) for implementing the MCP server and defining tools, using stdio transport.
NuGet Interaction: The official NuGet Client SDK (NuGet.Protocol, NuGet.Versioning, etc.).
Project/Solution Parsing: Microsoft.Build libraries (Evaluation, Construction) with Microsoft.Build.Locator.
Configuration:.NET IConfiguration with the Options pattern, reading from appsettings.json and secure sources.
Error Handling: Robust logging (ILogger<T>) and try-catch blocks within tool implementations, potentially returning structured errors via MCP if supported.
Performance: In-memory caching (IMemoryCache) for NuGet API responses and potentially parsed project data.
Testing: NUnit for unit testing with Moq for mocking dependencies [S_R6, S_R8, S_R11, S_R12, S_R14, S_R15, S_R20, S_R21, S_R23, S_R27, S_R29, S_R30, S_R31, S_R32, S
